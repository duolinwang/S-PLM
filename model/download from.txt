To use it, modify the first value of num_end_adapter_layers from 16 to 12. For example, "num_end_adapter_layers: [12,16]" for adapter tuning and "num_end_adapter_layers: 12" for other tuning, otherwise the pretrained model cannot be loaded successfully. 
Alternatively, you can use the same config files for S-PLM V1, but add parameter --num_end_adapter_layers 12 for other tuning and --num_end_adapter_layers "12-16" for 16 layers of adapter tuning.
